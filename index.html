      <p><strong>16th February, 2025</strong></p>
        <p>
          Lover Fest felt like a dream with you, but the most magical part was our moment — our own little 'Lover' moment.  
          That tight hug, the warmth, the comfort — it didn’t feel like a first meeting; it felt like home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything about you was just perfect — your kindness, your voice, your smile, your eyes — and then you showed up in my favorite color, stealing my heart effortlessly, like a lyric written just for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          If time could pause, I’d choose that moment over and over again.  
          Thank you so much, Ms. Beauty, for coming into my life!! 💖

      <p>To Utk, my little secret whispering magic,</p>
        <p>
          You walked into my life on a random February day,  
          but since then, nothing’s felt random at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          You’ve become my calm in chaos,  
          the smile I search for in the noise,  
          and the silence that feels full when you're near.
        </p>
        <p>
          In your laughter, I’ve found music.  
          In your voice, a sense of home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even our little fights… they carry warmth,  
          because they end with us understanding each other even more.
        </p>
        <p>
          You've seen me — the raw, messy, unfiltered me.  
          And yet, you stayed.  
          That means more to me than words can ever spell out.
        </p>
        <p>
          With you, I’ve felt what it means to be alive.  
          To be wanted.  
          To be held — not just in arms, but in heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          So here’s to you —  
          The one who turned my ordinary into something quietly magical.
        </p>
        <p>Happy Birthday, Bebu ❣️</p>
    </div>

    <div class="popup-content">
      <span class="close" onclick="closeLetter('letter3')">&times;</span>
      <p>
          You’re chaotic, expressive, loving, annoying, sweet — and everything in between.  
          You tease, you pout, you comfort, you demand.  
          You ask for too many kisses and then complain when I give just one.
        </p>
        <p>
          But most of all, you make me feel like I’m *wanted*.  
          And that’s something rare.
        </p>
        <p>
          From “MS Beauty” to “my safe place,”  
          you’ve become this rhythm in my everyday life — the voice in my head that sounds like mischief and love.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’re weird. We fight. We vibe.  
          We forgive. We repeat.  
          And that loop? Feels like home.
        </p>
        <p>
          I won’t say future, forever, or always.  
          I’ll just say — *right now*, you’ve made my world softer.  
          And that’s enough to write a love song about 💛
        </p>
